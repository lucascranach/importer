Two editions are known (a third one was probably planned, but never completed). The first edition was published in 1509 with 108 woodcuts by Lucas Cranach the Elder, showing reliquaries and treasures in the church of All Saints. The second edition contains a set of 119 woodcuts. This engraving served as the title-page to the second edition of the Wittenberg Heiligthumsbuch with an impression of Cranach's woodcut of the church of All Saints printed on the verso (Hollstein, 96). The title of the book 'Dye zaigung des hochlobwirdi= \/\/ gen hailigthumbs der Stifft \/\/ kirchen aller hailigen zu \/\/ wittenburg' was printed on the sheet above the image in letterpress. The engraving was also issued in a separate edition in which the versos are blank. \nThe image shows Elector Friedrich the Wise who ruled Saxony jointly with his brother, Duke Johann the Constant (1468-1532). They are set in a niche behind a ballustrade. Friedrich holds rosary beads in his hands and his gaze is directed piously upwards. Both are dressed in stately attire and the electoral coats of arms decorate the upper corners. Cranach has placed his insignia in a prominent position on a plaque at the centre of the ballustrade. \nTogether the brothers were responsible for enlarging the collection of treasures and relics for the church of All Saints begun by their ancestors. Friedrich later became an active supporter of Martin Luther and the Reformation and was excommunicated by the Pope in 1524.","provenance":"","medium":"","signature":"Artist's insignia in the plate, lower centre, on a plaque: winged serpent, facing right with raised wings; dated '1510'","inscription":"","markings":"","relatedWorks":"","exhibitionHistory":"","representativeObject":"AT_A_DG1929-75","bibliography":"","references":{"reprints":[{"text":"Abzug A","inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-75","remark":""},{"text":"Abzug A","inventoryNumber":"DE_SMBKSK_89","remark":""}],"relatedWorks":[]},"additionalTextInformation":[{"type":"Description\/ Interpretation\/ Comments","text":"These portrait engravings predate the first engraved portrait by D\u00fcrer, that of Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg of 1519.

During this time he paid a hasty visit to Wittenberg where he remained in complete seclusion seeing only Cranach who recognized him straight away.  Cranach portrayed him with a beard, looking out to the left and this image was to mark his return to the public stage in 1522. It was widely disseminated with at least four different textual variants and continued to be printed until late into the 16th century.

His face clearly expresses the extreme effort required to transport the infant Christ across the river. A hermit stands with a lantern on the shore in the right background. The electoral coats of arms suspended from the boughs at the upper left suggest that the woodcut was commissioned by Friedrich III the Wise.\nThe block was initially dated 1506, cut in the line block, but this date was later removed, corresponding with the second state. Competition between Cranach and his contemporaries led to the development of the chiaroscuro woodcut, a tonal block, which simulated heightening by leaving parts of the paper white and it may have prompted him to deliberately antedate the first state by two years. Certain other arguments also cast doubt on the date. Cranach was not entitled to use the coat of arms with a serpent, seen on this print, until 1508 when it was granted to him by Duke Friedrich and in fact, it is not displayed on any other print before 1509. The most likely sequence of events was that Cranach learnt of the advances made in Augsburg on the invention of the tone block soon after his return from the Netherlands in 1508, and then produced his own version in the 'St Christopher' and 'Venus' woodcuts around 1509.\n\n1st state [Dodgson 1911, 295-296, 61a-c] [Hollstein 56.79]:\na. with the date 1506.

This woodcut was commissioned by Friedrich III of Saxony together with the accompanying image of Hell. The elector is shown kneeling at the bottom of the ladder, while the Saxon shields are represented in the upper corners. Below the woodcut depicts two groups of men and women representing the church militant with a devil on either side. A ladder reaches at centre from the earth up to heaven, with the Holy Trinity at its head, in two circles, supported by the symbols of the Evangelists. On either side there is a group of Holy men and women, and several putti hover above. Numerous scrolls with text reveal that the image is a reference to St Bonaventura, who described the way to God using the metaphor of a celestial ladder. Cranach's image is a simplified representation of 'Itinerarium mentis in Deum', published in 1269. Here instead of the seven steps listed by Bonaventura only three are shown. \nThese bear inscriptions, printed in Gothic type. After the reformation (c. 1550) the woodcut was printed with a different text. Later impressions were also printed with a letterpress in latin type. In 1616 the medaillion with the trinity was removed from the block and used in the title-page of Passio D. N. Jesu Christ....

Upon a shield supported by four flying angels is displayed a heart, surmounted by flames confined within a crown. A crucifix is framed within the heart; a scroll with or without text (depending on the state of the impression) passes in front of the stem of the cross; descending flames form a pattern upon the right side of the heart. Beneath the shield is a landscape, containing a view of a castle surrounded by a deer park. In the foreground are two pairs of kneeling saints: the Virgin and St John at the centre, with St Sebastian and St Roche behind them. Their presence indicates that the print was associated with protection from the plague.\nThe date 1505 is placed, within the monogram, beneath St John, and the two coats of arms of Saxony occupy the lower corners, the electoral on the left, the ducal on the right. These shields denoting Cranach's official appointment make their first appearance here. The electoral shield with the two crossed swords has the earlier form, in which the lower half of the field is sable, the upper argent, while the ducal shield is shown with three leaves rather than the later five. This arrangement was reversed in the year 1507 or 1508, and many of Cranach's woodcuts were then altered. However, in this case the original shield remains unaltered even in late impressions and subsequent states. \nIn one state the scroll was empty and in another bears the inscription 'VIRGO MATER MARIA'. Late impressions of the state without text have the names, S. SEBASTIANVS . S.MARIA . S. IOHANNES . S. ROCHVS., printed on the lower margin.","provenance":"","medium":"","signature":"Artist's insignia in the block at the lower margin: 'LC,' dated '1505'","inscription":"The cross is titled 'IN R'I in the block","markings":"","relatedWorks":"","exhibitionHistory":"","representativeObject":"AT_A_DG1929-84","bibliography":"","references":{"reprints":[{"text":"Abzug A","inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-84","remark":""},{"text":"Abzug A","inventoryNumber":"US_MMANY_27-54-23","remark":""}],"relatedWorks":[]},"additionalTextInformation":[],"publications":[{"title":"Bartsch 1808","pageNumber":"287","referenceId":"241"},{"title":"Dodgson 1911","pageNumber":"281","referenceId":"346"},{"title":"Hollstein 1959","pageNumber":"44","referenceId":"736"},{"title":"Jahn, Bernhard 1972","pageNumber":"","referenceId":"1939"}],"keywords":[{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"01040304","path":"","url":""},{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"010403030124","path":"","url":""},{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"010403030140","path":"","url":""},{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"010403030143","path":"","url":""},{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"010403020414","path":"","url":""},{"type":"Schlagwort","term":"010501","path":"","url":""}],"locations":[{"type":"","term":"","path":"","url":""}],"repository":"","owner":"","sortingNumber":"","catalogWorkReferences":[{"description":"Hollstein","referenceNumber":"VI.44.69","remarks":""},{"description":"Bartsch","referenceNumber":"VII.287.44","remarks":""}],"structuredDimension":{"element":"Ma\u00dfstab CDA","width":"0.00","height":"38.00"},"restorationSurveys":[],"images":{"representative":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1489,"height":2036}},"variants":[{"xs":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":273},"src":"https:\/\/lucascranach.org\/imageserver\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84\/01_Overall\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84_Overall-xs.jpg"},"s":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":410},"src":"https:\/\/lucascranach.org\/imageserver\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84\/01_Overall\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84_Overall-s.jpg"},"m":{"dimensions":{"width":800,"height":1094},"src":"https:\/\/lucascranach.org\/imageserver\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84\/01_Overall\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84_Overall-m.jpg"},"l":{"dimensions":{"width":1200,"height":1641},"src":"https:\/\/lucascranach.org\/imageserver\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84\/01_Overall\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84_Overall-l.jpg"},"xl":{"dimensions":{"width":1489,"height":2036},"src":"https:\/\/lucascranach.org\/imageserver\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84\/01_Overall\/G_AT_A_DG1929-84_Overall-xl.jpg"}}]}}}

It is his first representation of a tournament and shows the events from an aerial perspective as they unfold on a large public square. It is one of a small group of woodcuts of jousting tournaments designed by Cranach between 1506 and 1509, which are based on events that took place in the market-place in Wittenberg [Hollstein, VI.93.117-119]. The complex design of this print contains numerous combatants on horseback jousting with lances in a square surrounded by buildings; the knight in the lower right corner with the letter 'A' ('Alt\u00f6sterreich'?) on his caparison is seen in other prints and possibly represents the Emperor Maximilian.

A chasm had suddenly appeared, which according to soothsayers could only be filled by throwing into it Rome's greatest treasure. Marcus Curtius interpreted this to mean the city's valiant youth and accordingly sacrificed himself, by leaping on horseback into the chasm which closed over his head (Livy 7:6). The armed and mounted soldier plunges into the chasm in the foreground; behind is a platform with a pavillion and seven figures; landscape background, the two Saxon shields are placed underneath the buildings's architrave.\nThe image provides an unusually specific illustration of the way in which the interests of the humanists at the court of Friedrich the Wise were broadcast through prints. Small objects of Italian Renaissance metalware were much sought after by the intellectual \u00e9lite, such as Friedrich's chancellor, Degenhart Pfeffinger (1471-1519), and the main part of this composition was inspired by a bronze of this type (possibly one attributed to Giovanni delle Opere or delle Corniole).

Kress Collection', London, 1965, pp.35-6, no. 108, fig. 129). Cranach has altered it into a complete figure of a laureated Roman emperor, watching the scene from a hillock. He has also expanded the composition in a lateral direction in order to fit the landscape, which gives an entirely Germanic setting to the subject, within and around the temple. Cranach has also given the temple more elongated proportions and added classicising details, including the profile portraits within roundels inserted into the spandrels. The intricate patterning of the soldiers' feet has, however, been retained from the bronze original, as has a figure style which is quite alien to Cranach's own.\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat.

In a dream the messenger Mercury appears to him and challenges him to choose the most beautiful of the three goddesses Juno, Minerva and Venus and award her with the golden apple. The apple of contention lies at his feet, while Mercury, Venus, Juno and Minerva stand before him. Cranach evolves a new form of representation by showing the goddesses naked [...] from different perspectives: the front, the back and in profile. He sets the figures in a northern landscape, the two Saxon shields are suspended from a bough.

Cranach transports the goddess to the dominion of his rulers with the landscape and the electoral shields shown together with the artist's insignia and dated '1506' seen here hanging from a branch at the right edge of the image. In fact, it cannot have been produced before 1508 when Cranach was presented with a coat-of arms by Friedrich the Wise.

This portrait has survived in a number of states. Shown as a bust-length figure this strict profile of Luther ranks it in the tradition of ruler portraits on coins and medallions. Luther is shown wearing a habit, but on this occasion instead of a tonsure he now wears a cap pushed to the back of his head, identifying him as an academic doctor. In contrast with the works from 1520 Luther appears less ascetic and considerably plumper.   \n[Exhib. Cat.
