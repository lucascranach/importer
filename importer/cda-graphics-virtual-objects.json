The title of the book 'Dye zaigung des hochlobwirdi= \/\/ gen hailigthumbs der Stifft \/\/ kirchen aller hailigen zu \/\/ wittenburg' was printed on the sheet above the image in letterpress. The engraving was also issued in a separate edition in which the versos are blank. \nThe image shows Elector Friedrich the Wise who ruled Saxony jointly with his brother, Duke Johann the Constant (1468-1532). They are set in a niche behind a ballustrade. Friedrich holds rosary beads in his hands and his gaze is directed piously upwards. Both are dressed in stately attire and the electoral coats of arms decorate the upper corners. Cranach has placed his insignia in a prominent position on a plaque at the centre of the ballustrade. \nTogether the brothers were responsible for enlarging the collection of treasures and relics for the church of All Saints begun by their ancestors.

Competition between Cranach and his contemporaries led to the development of the chiaroscuro woodcut, a tonal block, which simulated heightening by leaving parts of the paper white and it may have prompted him to deliberately antedate the first state by two years. Certain other arguments also cast doubt on the date. Cranach was not entitled to use the coat of arms with a serpent, seen on this print, until 1508 when it was granted to him by Duke Friedrich and in fact, it is not displayed on any other print before 1509. The most likely sequence of events was that Cranach learnt of the advances made in Augsburg on the invention of the tone block soon after his return from the Netherlands in 1508, and then produced his own version in the 'St Christopher' and 'Venus' woodcuts around 1509.\n\n1st state [Dodgson 1911, 295-296, 61a-c] [Hollstein 56.79]:\na. with the date 1506.
